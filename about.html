                <p>
                    In this blog I will upload a bible verse along with some notes I wrote while studying it. This verse would occasionally be the daily 
                    bible verse.
                </p>
                <p>The main purpose of this blog is to spread God's word.<br>But I also made it to encourage those who feel like God has left their 
                    side<br>or that He was never with them or those who seem to have relied on people<br>and now have nowhere to turn to.<br>I made this 
                    blog to tell them that they are not alone.<br>That there is a God and He never leaves His children behind.<br>
                    Because he never left me. I just couldn't feel Him.<br>This blog is to help bring His children back and bring them closer to Him.
