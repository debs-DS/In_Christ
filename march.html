            JOURNAL
        </h3>
        <p>
            Spend about 15-20 minutes journaling to God. Tell Him about your day, how you are feeling, stuff like that. Confide in Him about 
            anything and everything. You can start by saying "Hi Jesus" or "Dear Lord" - kind of like writing in a diary. You can also choose 
            to write a letter, but just write something to Him. Thank Him and ask Him for anything you wish for Him to do in your life.
        </p>

            EXPERIENCE
        </h3>
        <p>
            Spend another 15-20 minutes sitting in His presence and experiencing His love. You can put on worship music and just sit there and 
            let the Holy Spirit guide your thoughts.

            STUDY
        </h3>
        <p>
            Take 5 minutes to write down the verse of the day & say it out loud. Also try to memorize it as it can be used as a weapon when the 
            enemy tries to whisper lies into our ears or when we are unsure of what to do in certain situations.

            UNDERSTAND
        </h3>
        <p>
            Take 10-15 minutes to understand the verse of the day. Pray before this portion & ask the Holy Spirit to help you understand 
            anything He wants you to know.
        </p>
        <center><p style="font-weight: bold;">Ask yourself these 3 Q's:</p></center>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">What does this verse teach you about God?</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">What does this verse teach you about yourself?</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">How can you apply this verse to your life?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 style="color: lightgreen;">
            SPEAK
        </h3>
        <p>
            Take 5 minutes to think about everything you've just learnt and experienced. Put it all into a prayer and tell God the changes you want 
            Him to make in your life. Use your words to declare the verse of the day over your life. Use your words to speak goodness's truth over 
            your life, so you can stand confidently in the authority you have in Jesus.
