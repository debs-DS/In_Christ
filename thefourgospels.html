        </h3>
        <p>
            This is where we see John the Baptist preparing the way for the Messiah.<br>
            In verse 2, he says, "Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near".<br>
            John tells the people that they should "repent of their sins and turn to God". We as Christians know that Christ is coming back for us. 
            And it's the same concept for these people.<br>
            We are being told to "repent" "and turn to God". We are not only required to ask for forgiveness or to apologize to someone we've offended<br>
            or to give out to the poor after repentance. But to turn to God, because through Him everything is possible.<br>
            When you set your eyes on the Lord and open your heart to Him, you are able to do everything and anything that the Lord has set for you to do.<br>
            It could be that dream or goal you have. It could be what profession you aspire to be or the person you wish to be.<br>
            All these and more can be done only once we look to God (when we seek Him we shall find Him), when we follow His word and guidance 
            we shall be like Him.<br>
            Remember, "the Kingdom of God is near"<br><br>
            In verses 7 to 10, we see John "denouncing" the Pharisees and Sadducees who have gathered among the people and watched him baptize<br>
            He says, "You brood of snakes!" "Who warned you to flee the coming wrath? Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins<br>
            and turned to God. Don't just say to each other, 'We're safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.' That means nothing, for I tell you, God<br>
            can create children of Abraham from this very stones. Even now the ax of God's judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees.<br>
            Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruits will be chopped down and thrown into the fire."<br>
            There's quite a lot to take from this so I'll try to explain and summarize the key points of it.<br>
            He says, "Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God." This sort of gives me lukewarm Christianity vibes.<br>
            I don't really like using that word, but seeing as it was in the bible ...<br>
            John tells us that we shouldn't rely on our titles as Christians or our descends, but to "prove by the way we live". We as Christians shouldn't 
            think that because we go to church or wear a cross that we are fine in God's sight and that we can do or say as we like. <br>
            So many people who preach gospels didn't start out as Christians. John is telling us, both believers and none believers, that if we<br>
            decided to turn our hearts to God that we should make it clear by the way we live our lives.<br>
            This might be by reading His word (The Bible) and following it, or cutting off certain people from our lives, or not listening to secular music ... anything.<br>
            If we wish to truly repent, we are told to first of all turn to God and then prove our repentance by following in His footsteps (to be Christ-like).<br>
