                <li>ISRAEL GOES TO WAR WITH THE CANAANITES AS GOD COMMANDED THEM.</li>
                <li>THEY BREAK THEIR PROMISE TO GOD BY NOT CONQUERING ALL THE LAND AND ITS INHABITANTS, BUT INSTEAD LIVING AMONG THE PEOPLE.</li>
                <li>
                    GOD GETS ANGRY AND CURSES THEM, SAYING, "THE PEOPLE WILL BE THORNS IN THEIR SIDES, AND THEIR gods WILL BE A CONSTANT 
                    TEMPTATION TO THEM"
                </li>
                <li>THE GENERATIONS AFTER JOSHUA BEGAN TO WORSHIP 'Baal' AND OTHER gods.</li>
                <li>GOD GOT ANGRY AND SAID "I WILL NO LONGER DRIVE OUT THE NATIONS THAT JOSHUA LEFT UNCONQUERED WHEN HE DIED."</li>

            <div>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">OTHNIEL son of KENAZ</h3>
                <blockquote>JUDGES 3:7-11</blockquote>
                <ul style="display: block;">
                    <li>
                        The people of Israel began to serve Ball and Asherah poles, forgetting the Lord their God.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Lord was angry and sold them to Chushanrishathaim of Aram-naharaim (king of Mesopotamia) for eight years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Israelites cried for mercy and the Lord appointed Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, to judge Israel 
                        and they went to war and won by the grace of the Lord.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verse 11: "And the land had rest forty years, and Othniel the son of Kenaz"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The story of Othniel reminds us that when the Spirit of God takes control of your life, you will be able to achieve great things.

                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">EHUD son of GERA</h3>
                <blockquote>JUDGES 3:12-30</blockquote>
                <ul style="display: block;">
                    <li>
                        Israelites did evil again "and the Lord gave king Eglon of Moab control over Israel because of their evil."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eglon, the Ammonities, and the Amalekites defeated Israel, conquering and taking over Jericho and the city of palms. They 
                        served him for 18 years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Israelites cried out for mercy. The LORD then appoints Ehud, son of Gera, "a left-handed man of the tribe of Benjamin." 
                        The people send Ehud to deliver their tribute money to king Eglon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ehud makes a double-edged dagger and hid it under his clothes. "...Eglon, who was very fat." Ehud gives him the money and starts 
                        to head home and then turns back when he saw the idols near Gilgal. He tells Eglon that he has a secret message for him. Eglon told 
                        his servants to go out, then Ehud tells Eglon that he has a message from God. As Eglon starts to get up, Ehud stabs him in the gut. 
                        The dagger went so deep, that the handle disappeared in the king's fat so EHud did not pull out the dagger. Ehud leaves and locks the 
                        doors and escapes down the latrine. The servants came back and saw the door was locked and just assumed that their master was using the 
                        toilet. They waited a while and decided to find a key and opened the door and saw their master dead >o<
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ehud then gathers up the Israelites and they go to war with the Moabites. Mohab was conquered that day. There was peace for 80 years.
