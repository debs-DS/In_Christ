            <p style="color: lightgreen;">
                "Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law.<br>And we believed in Christ 
                Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law.<br>For no one 
                will ever be made right with God by obeying the law."

                <p style="color: lightgreen;">
                    Spend about 15 - 20 min journaling to God.<br>Tell him what's on your heart & talk to Him like you would a friend.<br>
                    You could start it like you would a diary, "Dear Jesus" or "Dear Lord", anything really.<br>
                    Thank him for anything and everything. Tell Him what bothers you, what you struggle with, areas in your life that you want 
                    Him to show His presence in.<br>
                    Pour your heart out to Him.

                <p style="color: lightgreen;">
                    Take 5 min to write down the verse of the day & say it out loud.<br> Memorize it and keep it in your heart.

                <h2 style="color: lightgreen;">U - UNDERSTAND</h2>
                <p style="color: lightgreen;">
                    Take 10 - 15 min to understand the verse of the day. It's easy for the Bible to just feel like a bunch of words until we're
                    actually intentional it & applying it to our lives. Pray before this and ask the Holy Spirit to help you understand 
                    anything He wants you to know.

                    Ask yourself these 3 Q'S:

                        <li>What does this verse teach you about God?</li>
                        <li>What does this verse teach you about yourself?</li>
                        <li>How can you apply this verse to your life?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 style="color: lightgreen;">S - SPEAK</h2>
                <p style="color: lightgreen;">
                    Take 5 mins to gather everything you've experienced up until this point & put it into prayer.<br>
                    Use your words to declare the verse of the day over your life, add prayer requests & stand in agreement with God's truth.<br>
                    Life and Death is in the power of your tongue. Use your words to speak God's truth over your life, so you can stand confidently 
                    in the authority you have in Jesus.
