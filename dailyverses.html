                <p>
                    For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God's glorious standard. Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his 
                    sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins.

                    the throne and before the Lamb. They were clothed in white robes and held palm branches in their hands. And they were 
                    shouting with a great roar, "Salvation comes from God who sits on the throne and from the Lamb!"
