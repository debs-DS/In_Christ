                        "In the beginning the Word already existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. He existed in the beginning 
                        with God. God created everything through him, and nothing was created except through him. The Word gave life to 
                        everything that was created, and his life brought light to everyone. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness 
                        can never extinguish it."

                        <li>The Word existed before all creation. The Word is <i>not</i> not God but "was with God". The Word = God</li>
                        <li>The Word is Jesus by the way</li>
                        <li>Christ is an uncreated being. <i>zoe</i> - the Greek word for life - means "the life principle". 
                        Jesus is the very principle of life.</li>
                        <li>He is the life and the light. Without Him we are lost and dead. Darkness can never and will never conquer this light.</li>
