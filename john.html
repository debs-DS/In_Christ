                "In the beginning the Word already existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. He existed in the beginning 
                with God. God created everything through him, and nothing was created except through him. The Word gave life to 
                everything that was created, and his life brought light to everyone. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness 
                can never extinguish it."

                <li>The Word existed before all creation. The Word is <i>not</i> not God but "was with God". The Word = God</li>
                <li>The Word is Jesus by the way</li>
                <li>Christ is an uncreated being. <i>zoe</i> - the Greek word for life - means "the life principle". 
                Jesus is the very principle of life.</li>
                <li>He is the life and the light. Without Him we are lost and dead. Darkness can never and will never conquer this light.</li>

                "He came to the very world he created, but the world didn't recognize him. He came to his own people, and even they rejected 
                him. But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God. They are reborn - not with 
                physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God. So the Word became human and made his home 
                among us. He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness. And we have seen his glory, the glory of the Father's one and only 
                Son."

            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; display: block;">
                <li>He came home. Human nature rejected (did not receive) God's word and Light</li>
                <li>The ones who received (had faith) Him became children of God. They were reborn not by the will of man, but by the will of God.
                They were born in Christ. They received the grace of acceptance</li>
                <li>He became human (flesh). He came to us so we didn't need to search for Him. "seen his glory" - literally, in the physical</li>

            <h3 style="color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">verse 17:</h3>
            <h3 style="color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">
                "For the law was given through Moses, but God's unfailing love and faithfulness came through Jesus Christ."
            </h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; display: block;">
                <li>Moses had given us the laws that we were to follow as GOd's children.</li>
                <li>Jesus brought us closer to God by teaching to us the love God had for His people. He allowed us to have a closer relationship 
                    with God as the Father and made us understand that we don't have to live in constant fear, but instead be grateful for the love 
                    the Father shows us.

                "No one has ever seen God. But the unique One, who is himself God is near to the Father's heart. He has revealed God to us."
            </h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; display: block;">
                <li>This verse also helps us understand that we don't have to be in constant fear. 
                </li>
                <li>In the Old Testament, we are told that you can't look at God and live so people might have imagined Him as a terrifying being.
                    But Jesus who is God the Son came down to earth, and so he "revealed God to us".
                </li>
                <li>We were able to see God through His Son, Jesus Christ</li>
