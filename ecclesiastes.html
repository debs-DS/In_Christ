                    The more Solomon understood, the more he learned, the more he realized he didn't know. The more wisdom he acquired about life, 
                    the more of life's sorrows he knew.<br>
                    Solomon pursued human wisdom alone, not walking with God. There is no point in chasing after anything other than the Lord. 
                    He is reflecting on the long life he spent chasing after knowledge from the earth and not God.<br>
                    This verse helps us understand that no matter what we do in life or whatever goals and dreams we decide to pursue, it is all 
                    useless if we do not turn to God and ask Him for guidance. As Christians, we are to look to God in whatever we do in order to 
                    accomplish anything and remain joyful at the end.

                        cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance. A time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones. A 
                        time to embrace and a time to turn away. A time to search and a time to quit searching. A time to keep and a time to 
                        throw away. A time to tear and a time to mend. A time to be quiet and a time to speak. A time to love and a time to

                    Solomon understood that though there are good things in life, the bad things can't be escaped. He describes life to have 'seasons',
                    'a time for everything'.<br>Unintentionally, as Christians, we tend to believe that just because we have God that bad things won't 
                    happen to us. On the contrary, because we have God bad things will happen to us and God will inevitably and miraculously get us through 
                    them.

                        can one be warm alone? A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three

                    What good is your success if you can't pass it on?<br>
                    There is a man who has no friends, no family to care for. This man strives everyday 
                    to earn more and more. He has no one to pass his wealth to, no one to share his victories and failures with, yet he works so hard to 
                    gain so much. Solomon paints a picture of lonely, pointless busyness.<br>
                    Without a friend, accomplishments are vain.<br>
                    Solomon tells us that friendships and companionship brings productivity, comfort, safety and security<br>
                    A triple-braided cord can represent the Trinity. A tight bond in which each person/individual in that bond complement each 
                    other's abilities.
